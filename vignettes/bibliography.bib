abstract = {Two important pieces of data can be obtained from a gas chromatograph. The output of the detector is either processed electronically or placed on a simple strip chart recorder. The first piece of data obtained is simply the time it took for a given component to travel through the column. The second important piece of information that is obtained is simply the size of the peak.},
