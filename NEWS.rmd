# GCalignR 1.0.7
___
* replacing defunct vegan::adonis by vegan::adonis2

# GCalignR 1.0.6
___
* Removing unused argument `gc_peak_df` from `align_peaks`

# GCalignR 1.0.5
___

* Bugfix in `choose_optimal_reference` that always selected the first sample as a reference. Thanks to Heberto del Rio who pointed this out on https://github.com/mottensmann/GCalignR/issues/27

# GCalignR 1.0.3.9

* **Speedboost** when setting `max_diff_peak2mean = 0`: In this special case there is no need to use a time-consuming iterative approach but peaks can be sorted simply based on absolute values. This is implemented in two steps. (1) Across all samples, unique retention times are extracted, sorted in increasing temporal order and written to a template data frame. (2) For each sample, peaks are matched to the corresponding row of the template data frame. 
* Small bug fixed that caused problems when plotting x-axis labels in `gc_heatmap`. 
* Added a test for detecting inconsistently ordered retention times within samples. Retention times are expected in increasing order, starting with the lowest number. If this assumption is violated, retention times are reordered and a warning is shown.

# GCalignR 1.0.3
___
* Added `fill = TRUE` as a parameter in `utils::read.table` when reading data from text within internal functions. *Loading GC data with utils::read.table failed in cases of missing values in a column (i.e. empty). This is the correct behaviour as missing data should always be coded explicitly by 'NA'*
* Tibbles are now coerced to data frames
* Added a new boolean parameter `remove_empty` for the main function `align_chromatograms`. If samples are empty  (i.e.. no peak) this parameter allows to remove those cases from the dataset to avoid problems in post-hoc analyses. By default `FALSE`, i.e.. all but the blank samples are kept.
* Added a new boolean parameter `permute` for the functions `align_chromatograms` and `align_peaks`. This allows to change the default behaviour of random permutation of samples during the alignment and might be useful if exact replication is needed.

# GCalignR 1.0.2
___

* The accompanying manuscript is published <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198311> and the citation has been added
* The function *beta* `read_empower2` allows to import HPLC data that has been generated using the EMPOWER 2 software

# GCalignR 1.0.1
___

**Bugfixes**

* A bugfix was applied for handling multiple blanks correctly.
* Progressbars are removed in non-interactive R sessions

___

# GCalignR 1.0.0

**New functions implemented**

* `choose_optimal_reference` offers an automatism to pick suitable references.
* `draw_chromatograms` allows to represent a peak list in form of chromatogram.
* `remove_blanks`allows to get rid of peaks that represent contamination after aligning a dataset
* `remove_singletons` allows to remove single peaks from the dataset after aligning
* `merge_redundant_rows` allows to merge rows that were not recognised as redundant during the alignment by increasing the threshold value for the evaluation of similarity

**Algorithm**

* Using `pbapply`, we implemented progress bars to inform the user about the progress and the estimated running time of intermediate steps in the alignment of peak lists.
* By implementing more efficient code, we were able to speed up the processing, especially picking references is faster by an order of magnitude. 
* Retention times are not rounded to two decimals anymore. Calculations still capture a precision of two decimals for computational reasons.
* Within the aligned results, retention times correspond to the input values. Linear adjustments are only used internally and are documented within the Logfile accessible in the output.
* Reference samples that are used for the coarse alignment of retention times can be picked using a novel algorithm that determines the average similarity across the dataset. 

**warning messages**

* Warnings addressing formatting issues are now more explicit and partly rephrased to avoid ambiguity.

**Plots** 

* Added horizontal axis to barplots summarising peak numbers in `plot.GCalign`.
* Changed to more prominent colours in binary heatmaps with `gc_heatmap`.
* The function `draw_chromatograms` was added as another visualisation tool. 

**Vignettes**

* We included a second vignette that explains the algorithm and the supported data in detail.

**Documentation**

* Helpfiles were rewritten to enhance clarity.
