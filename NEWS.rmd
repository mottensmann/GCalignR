# GCalignR 0.1.0.9000

___

## Changes since release 0.1.0

### Algorithm
* Retention times are not rounded to two decimals anymore. Calculations still capture a precision of two decimals for computational reasons. 
* Within the aligned results, retention times correspond to the input values. Linear adjustments are only used internally and are documented within the Logfile found in the output.

### Dependencies
The bioconductor package [MassSpecWavelet](http://bioconductor.org/packages/MassSpecWavelet/) is added as *in R* solution for picking peaks from GC data. 


### warning messages
* Warnings addressing formatting issues are now more explicit and partly rephrased to avoid ambiguity.

### Plots 
* Added horizontal axis to barplots summarising peak numbers in `plot.GCalign`.
* Changed to more prominent colours in binary heatmaps with `gc_heatmap`.

### Vignette
* Extended and rewritten to enhance clarity.
