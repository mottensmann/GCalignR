`GCalignR` provides simple functions to align peak lists obtained from Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detectors (GC-FID) based on retention times and plots to evaluate the quality of the alignment. The package supports any other one-dimensional chromatography technique that enables the user to create a peak list with at least one column specifying retention times as illustrated below.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.asp=1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "vignettes/Two_Chromas_Peak_List.png", dpi = 300)
```

As with other software you need to get used to the input format which is shown in the illustration:

* Row 1: Sample names
* Row 2: Variable names
* Row 3-N: GC data
    + Each block belongs to a sample as shown for sample A (green) and sample B (orange) above

### Installing GCalignR:

The latest release v1.0.7 is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GCalignR). [Click here](https://github.com/mottensmann/GCalignR/releases) for an overview of past releases and a brief description of applied changes.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("GCalignR", dependencies = T)
```

*The developmental version, currently identical to the CRAN release, is available here:*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!("devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { 
    install.packages("devtools")
} else if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mottensmann/GCalignR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Get started with GCalignR

To get started read the vignettes:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("GCalignR")
```

Basic usage of the main function to align peaks:

+ `data`: Path to a text file (see input format above), or list of data frames, each corresponding to a sample 
+ `rt_col_name`: column name of retention time values
+ `max_linear_shift`: Here, no adjustment of systematic linear drift
+ `max_diff_peak2mean`: Here, sort all peaks strictly by retention time
+ `min_diff_peak2peak`: Here, try to merge peaks when rt differs by less than 0.1

```{r}
library(GCalignR)
aligned <- align_chromatograms(data = peak_data[1:4], # list of data frame 
                               rt_col_name = "time", # retention time
                               max_linear_shift = 0, #
                               max_diff_peak2mean = 0, 
                               min_diff_peak2peak = 0.08) 
```

**The parameter values above differ from the defaults shown in the paper and the package vignette. In a nutshell, we now suggest in most cases to set `max_diff_peak2mean = 0`. This way peaks are first simply sorted based on the given retention time value and then purely `min_diff_peak2peak` specifies which peaks will be evaluated for a merge. Additionally, this enables the possibility for a considerable boost in computation speed of the first alignment steps (available since version 1.0.5, currently only on GitHub!)**

If you encounter bugs or if you have any suggestions for improvement (for instance on how to speed up the algorithm!), just contact meinolf.ottensmann[at]web.de

*Also I´m happy to provide help if you can´t get it to work. Usually it is easy to solve small problems. However, in order to simplify this process please send a short description of the problem along with the code you have been using as a script file (.R) together with a minimal example input file (.txt).*
